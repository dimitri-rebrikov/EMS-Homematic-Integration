# EMS-Homematic-Integration
Connect a Boiler with the EMS Bus to the Homematic Home Automation System

# Idea
The idea is to connect the Homematic Thermostats to the Boiler for the following functions:
- disable thermostats if the boiler is in the summer mode (i.e. no heating function)
- switch the boiler into the boost mode if one of the thermostats switched into the boost mode

# Implementation (Under Construction)

Basic circuit schematic is taken from the [Arhived EMSESP8266 project](https://github.com/dimitri-rebrikov/EMS-ESP/blob/1.9.4/doc/schematics/Schematic_EMS-ESP.png).

The parts I used for the circuit are in the [BOM](./BOM.xhtml).
